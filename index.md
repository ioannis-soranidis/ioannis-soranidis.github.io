I am a theoretical physicist trying to understand the deep connection between quantum physics and gravity. With a background in general relativity and quantum field theory, my research focuses on uncovering the true nature of black holes. I am especially interested in how singularities might be resolved and how these fundamental questions manifest through black hole thermodynamics and potential observational signatures.
